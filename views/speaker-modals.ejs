        <p>
          George graduated from Queen’s University in 1985 with a degree in Geological Engineering.  He worked as a consulting engineer in the field of stormwater management and became a partner in a civil engineering firm that practiced in the land development industry.  After 15 years as a consultant, George recognized the need for engineers to develop a more multi-disciplinary approach to complex problem solving. George left the consulting firm and returned to Queen’s University to become the Director of the Integrated Learning Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Director, George contributed to changes in the engineering curriculum and to the construction of the Integrated Learning Centre (Beamish Munro Hall), a building which was selected to represent Canada at the 2005 World Sustainable Building Conference.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Next, George identified an emerging opportunity for rooftop solar development resulting from the Ontario Government’s Green Energy Act.   To address this opportunity, he co-founded Greenlight Projects Inc., a company which provided due diligence and project management to the solar industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthering his consulting practice, George worked on a large-scale ground mount solar development and is currently working with a non-profit affordable housing provider.  His current projects are the design and construction of two mixed-use, multi-residential, affordable housing buildings in Hamilton.  In response to the need for reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions, the buildings are being designed and constructed to Passive House standards. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2007, George has also been Coordinator of Undergraduate Internship Program for the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Queen’s University, providing support to both employers and students.
